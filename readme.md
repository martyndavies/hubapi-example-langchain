# Hub API - LangChain, OpenAI and Node.js Example

In this example repository we will focus on building a simple agent that can consume and use the functions definitions provided by Superface using the LangChain.js library, OpenAI and Node.js.

## Run this example

Clone the repository, and run:

```
npm install
```

This will install the LangChain dependencies, as well as Axios for making HTTP requests to the Hub API.

After everything is installed you will need to add two API keys in `src/index.js`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=""
SUPERFACE_AUTH_TOKEN=""
```
